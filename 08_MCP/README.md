## Main Assignment

In this session, you will build an MCP server with OAuth authentication — a cat
shop application that exposes tools for browsing products, managing a cart, and
checking out.

The main entry point is:

```text
server.py
```

The server implementation lives in:

```text
app/
```

Available MCP tools:

- `list_products`
- `get_product`
- `add_to_cart`
- `view_cart`
- `remove_from_cart`
- `checkout`

## Setup

From this folder:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the MCP Server

Run the server locally:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Expose the server with ngrok

In a separate terminal, start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and
restart the server with it:

```bash
ISSUER_URL=https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app uv run server.py
```

> **Note:** The `ISSUER_URL` must match the public URL clients use to reach the
> server, otherwise OAuth authentication will fail.

## Outline

### Breakout Room #1

- Set up the MCP server with OAuth and the product database
- Explore the MCP tools: `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `checkout`

### Breakout Room #2

- Connect an MCP client to the server
- Build an end-to-end interaction flow using the MCP tools

## Ship

The completed MCP server and client integration!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the MCP server you built and a demo of the client interacting with it; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

## Share

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

Here's a template to get you started:

## Submitting Your Homework

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Review the MCP server code in `server.py` and the `app/` directory
2. Run the MCP server locally using `uv run server.py`
3. Connect to the server using an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, or a custom client)
4. Test all available tools: browsing products, adding to cart, viewing cart, removing items, and checkout
5. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### Question #1

Why is OAuth important for MCP servers, and what security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

#### Answer

Q: Why is OAuth important for MCP servers?

A: OAuth matters because when an MCP server is exposed over the network, it is reachable by anyone who has the URL, so the server needs a way to know who is calling and to keep the data of each user separate.

Q: What security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

A: There are many security considerations when exposing tools to AI clients, including but not lmited to:

- Prompt injection. As our agent reads tool descriptions and tool *outputs* as part of its context, a compromised tool could return text that instruct the agent to do something specific such as calling checkout and auto-buying items the end user might not want. It's critical for the agent to treat output as untrusted data.
- Credential exposure. It's also critical that a the user credentials (i.e. thebearer token) does not leak where a third party could misuse it to perform nefarious actions.
- Unverified third-party servers. When one connect their agent to someone else's MCP server, they implictly trust their tools and their descriptions, which can be written in a way to deceive.

### Question #2

What is Streamable HTTP transport in MCP, and why might you expose a server publicly with OAuth instead of using a local stdio connection?

#### Answer

Q: What is Streamable HTTP transport in MCP?

Streamable HTTP is the MCP transport that runs the server as a real web service at an HTTP endpoint (here `/mcp` )which is reachable by remote clients over the network and is able to stream responses back as they become ready, over a connection that stays open.

Q: Why might you expose a server publicly with OAuth instead of using a local stdio connection?

Stdio only works when the person using the server is also the person running it, on the same machine. When we need to manage and authenticate multiple usrs, we have to use a protocol like OAuth to grant access to tools and services running on the server.

## Activity 1: Extend the MCP Server

Add at least one new tool to the cat shop MCP server (e.g., `search_products`, `update_cart_quantity`, or `get_order_history`). Ensure the new tool integrates properly with the existing database and OAuth authentication. Demo the new tool through an MCP client and include it in your Loom video.

#### Answer

Added `update_cart_quantity to tools.py`

## Advanced Activity: Build a Custom MCP Client

Build a custom MCP client that connects to the cat shop server over Streamable HTTP, authenticates via OAuth, and orchestrates a multi-step shopping flow (browse → add to cart → checkout). Compare the developer experience of MCP-based tool integration vs. traditional REST API calls.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
