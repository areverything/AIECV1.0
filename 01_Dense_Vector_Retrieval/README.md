## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to. These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms.

- 🏗️ **Activities** - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** - Take on a challenge. These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation.

## Main Assignment

In this assignment, you will build a vector RAG application using LangChain v1, OpenAI embeddings, and Qdrant.

The main notebook is:

```text
01_Cat_Health_Vector_RAG_LangChain_Qdrant.ipynb
```

The notebook uses the bundled cat health guideline PDF in `data/cat_health_guidelines.pdf`.

### Setup

From this folder, install the environment with uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then open the notebook in Cursor or VS Code and select the Python/Jupyter environment created by uv.

You will also need an OpenAI API key available when running the notebook.

## 🏗️ Activity #1: Embedding Similarity

Run the embedding similarity primer in the notebook.

You will compare embeddings for terms like:

- `king`
- `queen`
- `banana`
- `cat`
- `veterinarian`
- `cat health guidelines`

#### ❓Question #1

Why is cosine similarity useful for dense vector retrieval?

##### ✅ Answer:

In embeddings, meaning is encoded in the direction of the vector, not its magnitude. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, so it captures how aligned their meanings are while ignoring length differences. That gives a stable, bounded score (-1 to 1) that's great for ranking, which is what a vector database does when it searches for the chunks whose "meaning" points closest to the query.

---

## 🏗️ Activity #2: Build the Vector RAG Pipeline

Run the notebook sections that:

1. Load the PDF into LangChain `Document` objects
2. Split the document into chunks
3. Embed the chunks
4. Store the chunk embeddings in in-memory Qdrant
5. Retrieve relevant chunks with similarity scores
6. Generate an answer grounded in retrieved context

#### ❓Question #2

Why is metadata important for a RAG application?

##### ✅ Answer:

There are many reasons why metadata is important. The key ones include giving the ability to refer to the exact page where the answer came from (citations), and providing more context to help you debug cases where bad retrieval might have happened.

#### ❓Question #3

What tradeoff do we make when choosing chunk size and chunk overlap?

##### ✅ Answer:

Larger chunks keep more of the context together but at the cost of adding noise and diluting a good match. On the other hand, smaller chunks might be more precise but may lose the surrounding context. Larger overlap means less chance of splitting a concept across multiple chunks, but creates duplicate content.

#### ❓Question #4

What does a similarity score help you understand, and what does it not prove by itself?

##### ✅ Answer:

The similarity score shows how close a chunk is to the query, and it can be used to rank the results (highest score first). It does not prove that the chunk actually answers the question though, as a chunk can be on-topic and still not contain the specific fact you need.

## 🏗️ Activity #3: Vibe Check Retrieval Quality

Run the notebook's vibe check queries and inspect both:

- The retrieved context
- The generated answer

#### ❓Question #5

For the vibe check queries, did the retrieved context seem relevant before generation? Why or why not?

##### ✅ Answer:

Yes, the context retrieved for the first three vibe check questions looked relevant, because the wording of those questions was similar to content in the PDF (preventive care, symptoms, feeding). The last vibe check question (whether a cat can help file taxes) has no relevant information in the document, so the assistant correctly responded that it did not have enough information in the PDF doc to answer.

---

## 🏗️ Activity #4: Tune Retrieval

Improve retrieval quality by changing one or more of:

- Chunk size
- Chunk overlap
- Retrieval `k`
- Query wording

Document what changed and whether retrieval improved.

##### Settings Changed:

- Reduced `chunk_size` from 1000 to 300
- Reduced `chunk_overlap` from 200 to 60

##### Settings Unchanged:

- Test question: "How many litter boxes should I have for my cats?"
- Kept `k = 4` constant

##### Results:

1. The top-result similarity score rose from **0.601** (baseline) to **0.718** (smaller chunks).
2. The top chunk became more on-target: the baseline returned generic "General Litter Box Considerations" text, while the smaller-chunk run returned the actual rule of thumb ("one litter box for each cat plus one additional box, or one litter box for each social group plus one additional box, if the number of social groups is known")
3. The retrieval improved overall. Having smaller chunks reduces the chance of mixing multiple topics into one embedding, so each vector is more likely to represent one specific idea which makes the fact match score higher and rank first.

## Optional Deep Dive: RAG From Scratch

If you want to look underneath the library abstractions, run the optional reference notebook:

```text
02_Cat_Health_Vector_RAG_From_Scratch.ipynb
```

It builds the same retrieval pipeline again with only:

- `pypdf` for extracting text from the PDF
- Python standard-library HTTP requests for calling OpenAI
- Handcrafted document, chunking, embedding, similarity-search, vector-store, and generation primitives

This notebook is a reference walkthrough, not an additional assignment. Its purpose is to make the responsibilities hidden by LangChain, Qdrant, and provider SDKs visible.
